Firewalls:

Juniper SRX series - As a basic NAT firewall it's okay, but once you get into IPsec VPNs, you're asking for trouble, it's simple as that. I would rather terminate IPsec VPNs on Cisco ASA, Fortinet, or Palo Alto devices.

Routers:

Juniper MX series - Junos is a layer 3 routing operating system at first, then layer 2 switching. My meaning with this is, the firewall, routing policies and routing protocol configuration is very easy to interpret, making it really easy to deploy a secure device.

Switches (including aggregation):

Arista - Being that it comes from a Cisco like command interface, configuring the switch port layer 2 configurations is stupidly easy, making the device setup go much faster.

Juniper EX/QFX series - Layer 2 switching with a myriad of VLAN configurations is easy but requires a number of configuration statements to convery that compared to other manufacturers.
