Laptops running all operating systems should be accepted, especially when they are used by volunteers for powering a conference. Just because I am an enthusist for a particular platform, does not mean I need to make it my everything 24/7/365. Like an auto mechanic, I do not like to troubleshoot my systems when I come home from work, which is why I treat my laptop and phone as appliances, and do not go too crazy on them. For that kind of stuff, get used devices that be thrashed and bashed.
